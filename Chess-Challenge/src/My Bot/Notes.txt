GetLegalMoves() seems to check the higher value pieces first

IDEAS:
* For both start and target squares, evaluate the following:
  - Is this protected?
	+ By how many pieces?
	+ By what pieces?
  - Is there an opponent piece that threatens this square?
	+ Consider if this could be a trade
	+ What is the power or point difference between my protecting/attacking pieces and their threatening pieces? (Back and forth trading)
  - What value is the piece I'm moving?
	+ Only really useful in combination with other info
  - How many opponents does this piece threaten (if I can figure that out)?
